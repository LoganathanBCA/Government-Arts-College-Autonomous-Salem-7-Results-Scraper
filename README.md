# 🎓 Student Results fetching Automation 🚀

This project automates the process of fetching 2023-2025 M.Sc. CS students 4th semester results from the [GACSLM7 eCampus portal](https://ecampus.cc/gacslm7/index.php) using Selenium and saves all results in an HTML file.  Afterward, it extracts each student's marks and totals them from the HTML file and paste it into student_results.xlsx. 📊

## 🚦 Usage

1. **Prepare the Excel file**  
   Create a `students.xlsx` file with at least the following columns:
   - `register_no`
   - `dob` (in `DD/MM/YYYY` or `YYYY-MM-DD` format)

2. **Place `msedgedriver.exe`**  
   Download and place the correct version of `msedgedriver.exe` in your project folder.

3. **Run the script**  
   Execute the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

   After completion, `output_process.py` will run automatically. 🏃‍♂️

4. **View Results**  
   Open `all_results.html` or `student_result.xlsx` to see all student results. 🎉

## 📝 Notes

## 🐞 Issues Faced When Creating This Project

- **DOB Field Formatting:**  
  Handling various date of birth formats in the Excel file required careful parsing and conversion to match the website's expected input.

- **Unable to Screenshot the Page:**  
  Direct screenshot automation was unreliable due to dynamic content and scrolling issues. As a workaround, web scraping was used to extract the required data.

- **Random Order of Student Papers:**  
  The order of subjects and the presence of arrears varied between students, making it challenging to extract marks consistently for each subject.
