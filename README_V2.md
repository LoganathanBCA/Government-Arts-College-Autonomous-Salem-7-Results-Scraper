# 🎓 Government Arts College (Autonomous), Salem - 7 Results Scraper

> Because nothing says "I care about my marks" like building a bot to scrape them 😤

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

I wanted to know how stupid I was compared to my classmates in our semester exam.

But everyone around me was like:  
🗣️ "Marks are personal da bro…"  
But then happily shared their:

- 📅 Date of Birth  
- 📆 Month of Birth  
- 📆 Year of Birth

Which was exactly what the college website required to show marks.  
So I said:  
**"If they won’t tell me, I’ll let the machine do the asking."**

---

## 💡 Solution

### Phase 1:
Manually entered details for 36 classmates.  
Regretted life choices.

### Phase 2:
Used Selenium to automate the process — scraped data like a pro.

## 🫠 The Reality of AI

ChatGPT helped, but not fully.  
I had to:

- Prompt 40+ times  
- Got the same wrong suggestions  
- Finally… read the docs 📚

> So yeah, AI isn’t magic, it’s just a tool.  
> You still gotta be a real one 🧠💪
